# VBA-challenge

Created a VBA program to search through different worksheets to compile a list of stocks with their year changes, percent changes, and total volumes. It also searched through to find the greatest increases, decreases, and volumes for each sheet. All of the VBA code can be found in the attached VBA-challenge.bas file.
